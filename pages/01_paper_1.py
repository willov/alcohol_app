## A Physiologically Based Digital Twin for Alcohol Consumption â€“ Predicting Real-life Drinking Responses and Long-term Plasma PEth

Current models for alcohol dynamics lack detailed dynamics of e.g., gastric emptying. 
We have constructed a more detailed model able to both explain differing dynamics of different types of drinks, as well as differences based on anthropometrics. 
Using the model, we can construct interactive use-cases where you can both simulate the dynamics of different drinks, and long-term clinical markers, personalized based on anthropometrics. The use-cases can be reached from the left sidebar, or using the links below. 

[The first use-case revolves around simulating a number of drinks, and observing the dynamics of e.g., ethanol in the blood and breath.](Alcohol_dynamics) 
Here you can specify anthropometrics, and then define a set of drinks and meals to simulate the dynamics of alcohol. 

The three other use-cases revolve around making long-term predictions of the clinical marker of alcohol use phosphatidyl ethanol (PEth). 
[Firstly to evaluate if self-reported weekly use of alcohol and measured PEth levels are in agreement](Evaluating_reported_PEth_levels). Secondly, to showcase [how weekly use of alcohol leads to different values of PEth affected by anthropometrics](Anthropometric_differences_in_PEth). Finally, [how different types of drinks affect the PEth levels](Drink_type_impact_on_PEth).

We hope that this model and the applications can be used to make more informed decisions on alcohol consumption.

### Interactive demos

This section contains four interactive demonstrations:

- **Alcohol dynamics** - Simulate drinks and observe dynamics of ethanol in blood and breath
- **Anthropometric differences in PEth** - See how body characteristics affect PEth levels
- **Drink type impact on PEth** - Compare how different drink types affect PEth
- **Evaluating reported PEth levels** - Check if self-reported alcohol use matches PEth measurements
